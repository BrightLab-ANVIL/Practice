A place to practice git and GitHub
--------------

This repository contains two bash scripts that pre-process a T1-weighted MRI dataset.

Don't worry about doing anything wrong - this is a place for practicing and permissions are set so you cannot change the master branch without a PR anyway.

For guidance on our GitHub workflow, please read this page on the lab website:
