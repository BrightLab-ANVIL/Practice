A place to practice git and GitHub
--------------

This repository contains three scripts: one written in BASH, one written in Python and one written in MATLAB.

Feel free to change any of them, to test your git and GitHub skills!

Don't worry about doing anything wrong - this is a place for practicing and permissions are set so you cannot change the master branch without a PR anyway.

For guidance on our GitHub workflow, please read this page on the lab internal website:
