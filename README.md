# Practice

A place to practice git (with code that processes MRI files using bash, AFNI and FSL)
--------------

This repository contains two scripts that pre-process a T1-weighted MRI dataset. 
Use this to practice your git and github skills. 
It assumes you have AFNI ans FSL installed.

Run the scripts like:
x.T1_bet *input1* *input2* and 
x.T1_seg *input1* *input2*

Suggested steps:
1. Fork this repository (central repo) to your own GitHub
2. Clone your forked GitHub repo onto your local machine
3. Run the code on your machine
4. Make edits to the code (even if very simple)
5. Push these changes back to *your* forked repo
6. Put in a pull request to compare a branch of your forked repo with the master branch of this central repo
