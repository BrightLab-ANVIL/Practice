A place to practice git and GitHub
--------------

This repository contains three scripts:

One written in BASH
One written in Python
One written in MATLAB

Feel free to change any of them, to test you git and GitHub skills.

Don't worry about doing anything wrong - this is a place for practicing and permissions are set so you cannot change the master branch without a PR anyway.

For guidance on our GitHub workflow, please read this page on the lab website:
